# Airline_Company_System
## Data Warehouse Project
In this Project:
* I built the airline company model
* I analyzed what flights the companyâ€™s frequent flyers take, what fare basis they pay, how often they upgrade, how they earn and redeem their frequent flyer miles, whether they respond to special fare promotions, how long their overnight stays are, and what proportion of these frequent flyers have gold, platinum, or titanium status.
* My analysis also includes the reservation process where the finance team will be interested in analyzing the company profit and customer care interaction before, within, and after the trip in order to handle customer inquiries, and complaints and keep their feedback for business enhancements.
